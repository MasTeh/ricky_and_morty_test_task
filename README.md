# Test task for Bitsgap

This project was developed as part of a test assignment, focusing on clean and scalable code architecture.

## Key Technologies and Methodologies

1. **Freezed**: Leveraged to generate immutable data classes and union types, enabling reliable, type-safe model handling and ensuring consistency across data layers.
2. **Clean Architecture**: Implemented a modular structure to achieve high code maintainability and testability, with clear separation of responsibilities among layers (Data, Domain, and Presentation).
3. **MobX**: Integrated MobX for state management, allowing for responsive UI updates through observable states and actions, creating a dynamic and reactive user experience.
4. **Error Tracking**: Robust error tracking mechanisms have been incorporated to detect, log, and manage runtime issues, providing enhanced stability and debugging support.

## Additional Notes

- The project structure is designed to facilitate future expansion and maintain clean dependencies across layers.
- Error handling and logging ensure any issues can be effectively diagnosed and resolved.
